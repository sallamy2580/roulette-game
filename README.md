# Lunch Roulette (OSS)

### by its original AUTHORS

Ciprian bought and we took heavy inspiration from the [Flask Mega Tutorial](https://courses.miguelgrinberg.com/p/flask-mega-tutorial) which we wholeheartedly recommend you to read in order to quickly grasp how we built our (now open sourced under a [BSD-3 license](LICENSE)) implementation of the decade old [Lunch Roulette](https://hbr.org/2013/01/a-new-way-to-network-inside-yo) idea.

[WE](AUTHORS) have enjoyed running [our Lunch Roulette](https://www.lunch-roulette.org/) on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) which was, and still is, a great fit for this implementation.

P.S. at this moment we have no further plans to update this codebase.

#### Installing your developer environment

- run ./runme.sh to get the NTLM proxy, PostgreSQL and required deps up and running
- then later, run ./local/install.sh to get a local python virtualenv for faster iteration

#### NOTE: use _git grep your_ to find the ids & keys you should change before deploying it
